sbPopover
=========

    <div sb-popover-show="open"></div>

A small directive for managing the showing and hiding of elements such as popovers and dropdowns which are shown floating over the page. 

Basically equivalent to ngShow, with added behaviour for hiding on escape or tab key press and click events outside the element.
